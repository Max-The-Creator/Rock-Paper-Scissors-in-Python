# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is a simple command-line game of Rock Paper Scissors. The player competes against the computer, and the winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply run the `rock_paper_scissors.py` file with Python 3:


## How to Play

1. At the start of the game, the player and computer both choose a move (rock, paper, or scissors).
2. The winner is determined based on the following rules:
   - Rock beats scissors
   - Scissors beats paper
   - Paper beats rock
3. If both the player and computer choose the same move, the game is a tie.
4. The first player to win two rounds is the winner of the game.

## Features

- The player can choose their move by entering it on the command line.
- The computer's move is chosen randomly using the `random` module.
- The program checks that the player enters a valid move (rock, paper, or scissors) and prompts the player to re-enter their move if an invalid move is entered.
- The program keeps track of the score and displays it after each round.
